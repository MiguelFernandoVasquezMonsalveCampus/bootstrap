                <p><strong>Slowdive </strong>are a British rock band that formed in Reading, Berkshire, in 1989. The band consists of
                    Rachel
                    Goswell on vocals and guitar, Neil Halstead on vocals and guitar, Christian Savill on guitar, Nick
                    Chaplin
                    on bass and Simon Scott on drums, all of whom have played on the band's debut Just for a Day in
                    1991.
                    Halstead is the band's primary songwriter. </p>
                <h5>Personnel:</h5>
                <li>Neil Halstead — vocals, guitar, keyboards (1989-1995, 2014-present)</li>
                <li>Rachel Goswell — vocals, guitar, keyboards, tambourine (1989-1995, 2014-present)</li>
                <li>Nick Chaplin — bass (1989-1995, 2014-present)</li>

            <p class="text-white">Goswell and Halstead had known each other since early childhood. The band is one of
                the most prominent within
                the shoegaze scene, which rose to prominence in England during the early 1990s. While the band's second
                album Souvlaki initially received mixed reviews upon release, it has since been recognized as one of the
                best releases of the 1990s and one of the greatest shoegaze albums of all time.</p>

            <p class="text-white">The band broke up soon after the release of their third album Pygmalion in 1995,
                having seen Scott, Savill
                and Chaplin all depart the band prior. The remaining members continued under a more folk and
                country-influenced direction as Mojave 3. Slowdive reunited in 2014 to play the Primavera Sound
                festival,
                and released a self-titled album in 2017, their first in 22 years. </p>

                            <p class="card-text">By mid-1991, Slowdive had been tagged a "shoegazing" band and
                                part of "the scene that celebrates itself"
                                by the British media. The term shoegazer was applied to bands that followed My
                                Bloody Valentine's
                                example of abrasive guitars and ethereal vocals, while "the scene" represented these
                                like-minded
                                groups and their social behaviour; shoegazers typically mingled at each other's
                                gigs. Slowdive
                                toured with other shoegazing bands through summer 1991. The British music press
                                became increasingly
                                derisive of shoegazing as the Britpop and grunge movements came underway.

                                Production on Slowdive's debut commenced shortly after Halstead convinced Alan
                                McGee, head of Creation
                                Records, that the band had enough songs written for a full-length album, which was
                                not actually true.
                                The group hurriedly started writing songs in the studio. Experimentation with sounds
                                and cannabis
                                occurred during the process. Halstead drew lyrical inspiration from the abstract
                                nature of the music. He
                                recounted, " went into a studio for six weeks and had no songs at the start and at
                                the end we had an
                                album".

                                Their debut, Just for a Day was released in September 1991 and placed in the top 10
                                on the UK Indie
                                Chart. NME gave the record a positive review, but most of the press generally
                                disliked the album
                                as a backlash against shoegazing began. As writer Peter Buckley put it, the album
                                was "dismissed as
                                dreary and lacking in ideas". Melody Maker writer Paul Lester railed against the
                                debut, calling it a
                                "major fucking letdown". This backlash worsened when critics reevaluated shoegazing
                                after the
                                release of My Bloody Valentine's Loveless in November 1991. </p>

                            <p class="card-text">While they toured in early 1992 to support Blue Day, a re-release
                                of their early EP material, the band began writing songs for a follow-up album, but the
                                negative coverage Slowdive received in the press affected their songwriting. " did
                                affect us as we were all teenagers at the time", said Scott in a 2009 interview, "
                                couldn't understand why people were so outraged by our sound that they had to tell the
                                NME or whoever that they wanted us dead!" Approximately 40 songs were recorded and
                                rerecorded as the group became very self-conscious of their writing and how it might be
                                received. When McGee listened to the new material, he subsequently dismissed it,
                                stating, "They're all shit". The band discarded all the music and started over. In a
                                2009 interview, Halstead vividly recalled the incident: "I remember going to start the
                                record in a studio in Bath. Spiritualized had just been there and left a huge Scalextrix
                                in the live room. I remember thinking this was the height of indulgence! Ironically we
                                scrapped everything we recorded...we had to start the record again back in Oxfordshire.
                                We should have just played with the Scalextrix for a month".</p>

                                their final album, Pygmalion, Halstead had moved Slowdive away from the dreamy guitar
                                sound and warm yet solemn tone of earlier releases to a newer, more minimalist extreme,
                                similar to heavily ambient bands such as Seefeel, A.R. Kane and Labradford.

                                Slowdive were dropped by Creation a week after the release of Pygmalion (as were

                                fourth studio opus, their first in 22 years. Self-titled with quiet confidence,
                                Slowdive's stargazing alchemy is set to further entrance the faithful while beguiling a
                                legion of fresh ears. Deftly swerving what co-vocalist/guitarist Rachel Goswell terms "a
                                trip down memory lane," these eight new tracks are simultaneously expansive and the
                                sonic pathfinders' most direct material to date. Birthed at the band's talismanic
                                Oxfordshire haunt The Courtyard, their diamantine melodies were mixed to a suitably
                                hypnotic sheen at Los Angeles' famed Sunset Sound facility by Chris Coady. "It's poppier
                                than I thought it was going to be," notes principal songwriter Neil Halstead, who was
                                the primary architect of 1995's previous full-length transmission Pygmalion. This time
                                out the group dynamic was all-important. "When you're in a band and you do three
                                records, there's a continuous flow and a development. For us, that flow re-started with
                                us playing live again and that has continued into the record." "There's a different

                <p>Slowdive are a British rock band that formed in Reading, Berkshire, in 1989. The band consists of
                    Rachel
                    Goswell on vocals and guitar, Neil Halstead on vocals and guitar, Christian Savill on guitar, Nick
                    Chaplin
                    on bass and Simon Scott on drums, all of whom have played on the band's debut Just for a Day in
                    1991.
                    Halstead is the band's primary songwriter. </p>

        <div class="container bg-secondary rounded p-5">

            <p class="text-white">Goswell and Halstead had known each other since early childhood. The band is one of
                the most prominent within
                the shoegaze scene, which rose to prominence in England during the early 1990s. While the band's second
                album Souvlaki initially received mixed reviews upon release, it has since been recognized as one of the
                best releases of the 1990s and one of the greatest shoegaze albums of all time.</p>

            <p class="text-white">The band broke up soon after the release of their third album Pygmalion in 1995,
                having seen Scott, Savill
                and Chaplin all depart the band prior. The remaining members continued under a more folk and
                country-influenced direction as Mojave 3. Slowdive reunited in 2014 to play the Primavera Sound
                festival,
                and released a self-titled album in 2017, their first in 22 years. </p>

            <h2>1991-1992: Just for a Day</h2>

            <!--             <p>By mid-1991, Slowdive had been tagged a "shoegazing" band and part of "the scene that celebrates itself"
                by the British media. The term shoegazer was applied to bands that followed My Bloody Valentine's
                example of abrasive guitars and ethereal vocals, while "the scene" represented these like-minded
                groups and their social behaviour; shoegazers typically mingled at each other's gigs. Slowdive
                toured with other shoegazing bands through summer 1991. The British music press became increasingly
                derisive of shoegazing as the Britpop and grunge movements came underway.

                Production on Slowdive's debut commenced shortly after Halstead convinced Alan McGee, head of Creation
                Records, that the band had enough songs written for a full-length album, which was not actually true.
                The group hurriedly started writing songs in the studio. Experimentation with sounds and cannabis
                occurred during the process. Halstead drew lyrical inspiration from the abstract nature of the music. He
                recounted, " went into a studio for six weeks and had no songs at the start and at the end we had an
                album".

                Their debut, Just for a Day was released in September 1991 and placed in the top 10 on the UK Indie
                Chart. NME gave the record a positive review, but most of the press generally disliked the album
                as a backlash against shoegazing began. As writer Peter Buckley put it, the album was "dismissed as
                dreary and lacking in ideas". Melody Maker writer Paul Lester railed against the debut, calling it a
                "major fucking letdown". This backlash worsened when critics reevaluated shoegazing after the
                release of My Bloody Valentine's Loveless in November 1991. </p>
